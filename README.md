## Title of the Project
Land Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
A machine learning-based model designed to predict land prices using historical data, aiding buyers, investors, and developers in making informed decisions regarding real estate investments.
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Land Price Prediction System employs machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the prices of land based on various factors. With regression models at its core, the system leverages historical datasets containing key attributes such as land area, proximity to cities, soil fertility, water availability, weather conditions, and year of purchase. This project is particularly valuable for buyers and investors who seek a realistic evaluation of land prices, as well as for developers aiming to optimize pricing strategies.
